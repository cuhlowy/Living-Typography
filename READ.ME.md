# Living Typography: WILD JUNGLE

## Overview
This is an interactive typographic experience inspired by the jungle. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with GSAP for animation), the project turns text into living elements that move, react, and engage users through both visual and auditory feedback.

## Concept
Words like "ROAR", "CHIRP", and "HISS" come to life with matching jungle animal animations and sounds. The title "WILD" sways like blowing in the wind using GSAP animation, while interactive leaves slide in as users click across the page.

## Features
- **Interactive Typography**: Clickable words play corresponding sounds and trigger custom animations.
- **Ambient Jungle Soundscape**: Background audio with birds and nature sets the mood.
- **Animated Jungle Elements**: Tiger paw, bird, and snake slide in with each interaction.
- **Leaf Trail**: Clicking empty space triggers sliding leaves and rustling sounds.
- **Responsive Design**: Layout adjusts for different devices using media queries and `clamp()`.

## Technical Details
- GSAP
- Responsive media
- Pixabay for sounds 
- Leaves, tiger paw, snake, and bird were all drawn on Procreate
- Background is AI generated

## Accessibility
- Alt text added to all images for screen readers
- Clear font choices and large text for readability
- Hover effects and high-contrast colors help visual engagement
- Future improvements: keyboard navigation and having the animals only pop out when the leaves are out
